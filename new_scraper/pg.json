generally 45 to 90 days into management.\n\nWhile, intuitively, it makes sense to prepare someone for a job before they start doing it, the team has found managers are most receptive to learning after they\u2019ve had some time in the new role and gathered some experience upon which to reflect.\n\nbuild\n      Tool: Review Google\u2019s new manager training\n\nGoogle's new manager training materials have been used to train thousands of Googler managers all over the world.\n\nThese materials have been consolidated and adapted from Google's internal manager development resources.\n\nThey have been shared here as Google Documents."}, {"source": "https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5749328048029696/", "content": "These materials have been consolidated and adapted from Google's internal manager development resources.\n\nThey have been shared here as Google Documents.\n\nTo customize and edit the documents, when looking at one of the documents, click \"File\" then select \"Make a copy\" to make your own editable version of the document.\n\nNew Manager Training Facilitator Guide\n\nStart here.\n\nThis facilitator guide includes the speaking notes and context to run this new manager training.\n\nget_app Download PDF\n\nopen_in_browser Open as Google Doc\n\nNew Manager Training Facilitator Slides\n\nThese are the slides to be displayed during the manager training session.\n\nThe speaker notes are NOT in this document -
