reflect developers\u2019 own perceptions (Meyer et al.\n\n2014).\n\nDevelopment doesn\u2019t change\nDevelopment activity on GitHub is a good proxy for activity that is fairly robust to shifting work routines.\n\nWhile some things like kanban boards may have moved from whiteboards to online tools, development can be observed via the same pushes, pull requests, and issues regardless of whether we

used offers insights into what may be happening: Issues are used for communication and planning.\n\nThey are how many users track tasks, enhancements, features, and bugs.\n\nIn our personal or hobby development, we may not go to the trouble of doing planning (or at least not logging it in an issue\u2014we may just put it on a sticky note).\n\nHowever, enterprise development is usually much more

development and the move to remote work and newly \u201cforced\u201d distributed teams.\n\nA probable explanatory scenario could be:\n\nAs teams scrambled to work from home, meetings to create more work (logged in issues) slowed or stopped.\n\nIssues remain unchanged.\n\nDevelopers continued to work through already logged issues as they shifted to remote work.\n\nIssues slowly decrease.\n\nTeams

upcoming work again.\n\nIssues spike.\n\nWe\u2019re happy to see this relatively fast recovery, which may be an initial rebound to the strong dip we saw in February.\n\nGiven the complexity required to shift and adapt to the demands and requirements of new work, combined with the general economic uncertainty and extended shelter-in-place orders, we anticipate fluctuations to continue and settle

impacts are more likely to show up in the data\u2014and our sample size was large enough to be significant and not be overly influenced by a few organizations.\n\nWork day and work volume: US Pacific

work being done by developers over this same time period.\n\nThis helped us understand if developers\u2019 workdays might be stretching longer while doing the same amount of work.\n\nThat is, perhaps developers are working in smaller shifts spread out over the day to accommodate family or childcare, but doing approximately the same amount of work as before.\n\n(For example, three three-hour blocks spread out over 12 hours equates to a 12-hour workday with our proxy measure but is equivalent to a traditional nine-hour workday, which is eight hours of work with a one hour lunch, when not having to accommodate a stretched schedule).\n\nTherefore, we also investigated how often they pushed code in that timeframe as a rough proxy of amount of work done.\n\nWe call this work volume."},

likely impacted by those who typically commute to an office \u201crecovering\u201d that time now that they work from home.\n\nWhile this time could be split between home tasks and work activity, developers may be feeling pressure to push more often, and thereby showing this increased work volume in the data due to several factors: economic uncertainty and the desire to do well and stay employed, using work as a distraction to combat boredom when stuck at home, pressure from management to get products to market, or team norms to push frequently to maintain fast and stable software

data identified in Theme #2.\n\nTime to merge pull requests\n\nA pull request is how developers tell others about changes they make to a repository.\n\nMerging a pull request involves a group of interested developers reviewing changes, discussing modification, and sometimes doing follow-up work through commits.\n\nFinally, the pull request is merged into the relevant branch of the intended repository.\n\nTo proxy this full collaborative process and see how it may have changed compared to last year, we measured the time to merge pull requests.\n\nIn Theme #1: Productivity and activity, we observed that pull requests created per user had remained relatively consistent or increased compared to last year."}, {"source":

activity, we observed that pull requests created per user had remained relatively consistent or increased compared to last year.\n\nHowever, we do see that users\u2019 behavior around pull requests has shifted: In January, time to merge took longer than last year by four to five hours for repositories owned by Enterprise Cloud accounts, and approximately one hour longer than last year for repositories owned by paid Team accounts.\n\nThis increased time to merge pull requests early in the year is an interesting observation, and one we don\u2019t have an explanation for.\n\nIn March, we saw the average time to merge pull requests drop: repositories owned by Enterprise Cloud accounts took 15-30 minutes longer to merge a pull request compared to last year (showing three hours or more improvement from January), and repositories owned by paid team accounts took about the same amount of time to merge compared to last year (showing approximately an hour improvement from January)."},
