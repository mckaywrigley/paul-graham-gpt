By April 30, 2020, The World Health Organization\n(WHO) recorded more than 3 million confirmed cases and 217,769 deaths (WHO 2020a ).\nWith wide-spread transmissions in 214 countries, territories or areas, the WHO declared\nit aPublic Health Emergency of International Concern (WHO 2020b ) and many jurisdic-\ntions declared states of emergency or lockdowns (Kaplan et al. 2020 ). Many technology\ncompanies told their employees to work from home (Duffy 2020 ).\nThinking of this situation as a global natural experiment in working from home\u2014the\nevent that would irrefutably verify the benefits of working from home\u2014would be na \u00a8\u0131ve.\nThis is not normal working from home. This is attempting to work from home, unexpect-\nedly, during an unprecedented crisis. The normal benefits of working from home may not\napply (Donnelly and Proctor-Thomson 2015 ). Rather than working in a remote office or\nwell-appointed home office, some people are working in bedrooms, at kitchen tables and on\nsofas while partners, children, siblings, parents, roommates, and pets distract them. Others\nare isolated in a studio or one-bedroom apartment. With schools and childcare closed, many\nparents juggle work with not only childcare but also home schooling or monitoring remote\nschooling activities and keeping children engaged. Some professionals have the virus or are\ncaring for ill family members.\nQuarantinework!== Re motework.I\u2019veb e e nworkingremotelywithsuccess for 13\nyears,andI\u2019venever bee nclose to b urnout.

There are no modern studies of working from home during a pande-\nmic of this magnitude because there has not been a pandemic of this magnitude since before\nthere was a world wide web. Therefore, software companies have limited evidence on how\nto support their workers through this crisis, which raises the following research question.\nResearch question: How is working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic\naffecting software developers\u2019 emotional wellbeing and productivity?\nTo address this question, we generate and evaluate a theoretical model for explaining\nand predicting changes in wellbeing and productivity while working from home during4928 EmpiricalSoftwareEngineering(2020)25:4927\u20134961\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply.

Moreover, we provide recommendations for professionals and organizations to\nsupport employees who are working from home due to COVID-19 or future disasters.\n2 Background\nTo fully understand this study, we need to review several areas of related work: pandemics,\nbioevents and disasters; working from home; and productivity and wellbeing.\n2.1 Pandemics,BioeventsandDisasters\nMadhav et al. ( 2017 ) defines pandemics as \u201clarge-scale outbreaks of infectious disease over\na wide geographic area that can greatly increase morbidity and mortality and cause signifi-\ncant economic, social, and political disruption\u201d (p. 35). Pandemics can be very stressful not\nonly for those who become infected but also for those caring for the infected and worrying\nabout the health of themselves, their families and their friends (Kim et al. 2015 ; Prati et al.\n2011 ). In a recent poll, \u201chalf of Canadians (50%) report[ed] a worsening of their mental\nhealth\u201d during the COVID-19 lockdown (ARI 2020 ). In Australia, the pandemic appears to\nhave doubled the incidence of mental health problems (Fisher et al. 2020 ).\nA pandemic can be mitigated in several ways including social distancing (Anderson\net al. 2020 ): \u201ca set of practices that aim to reduce disease transmission through physical\nseparation of individuals in community settings\u201d (p. 120-14 Rebmann 2009 ), including pub-\nlic facility shutdowns, home quarantine, cancelling large public gatherings, working from\nhome, reducing the number of workers in the same place at the same time and maintaining\na distance of at least 1.5\u20132m between people (Rebmann 2009 ; Anderson et al. 2020 ).\nThe extent to which individuals comply with recommendations varies significantly and\nis affected by many factors. People are more likely to comply when they have more self-\nefficacy; that is, confidence that they can stay at home or keep working during the pandemic,\nand when they perceive the risks as high (Teasdale et al. 2012 ). However, this \u201cthreat\nappraisal\u201d depends on: the psychological process of quantifying risk, sociocultural perspec-\ntives (e.g. one\u2019s worldview and beliefs; how worried one\u2019s friends are), \u201cillusiveness of\npreparedness\u201d (e.g. fatalistic attitudes and denial), beliefs about who is responsible for miti-\ngating risks (e.g. individuals or governments) and how prepared one feels (Yong et al. 2017 ,\n2019 ; Prati et al. 2011 ).\nPeople are less likely to comply when they are facing loss of income, personal logistical\nproblems (e.g. how to get groceries), isolation, and psychological stress (e.g. fear, boredom,\nfrustration, stigma) (DiGiovanni et al. 2004 ). Barriers to following recommendations include\njob insecurity, lack of childcare, guilt and anxiety about work not being completed, and the\npersonal cost of following government advice (Teasdale et al. 2012 ; Blake et al. 2010 ).\nFor employees, experiencing negative life events such as disasters is associated with\nabsenteeism and lower quality of workdays (North et al. 2010 ). Employers therefore need\nwork-specific strategies and support for their employees. Employers can give employees\na sense of security and help them return to work by continuing to pay full salaries on\ntime, reassuring employees they they are not going to lose their job, having flexible work\ndemands, implementing an organized communication strategy, and ensuring access to util-\nities (e.g. telephone, internet, water, electricity, sanitation) and organisational resources\n(North et al. 2010 ; Donnelly and Proctor-Thomson 2015 ; Blake et al. 2010 ).\nWork-specific strategies and support are also needed to ensure business continuation\nand survival. The disruption of activities in disasters simultaneously curtails revenues andEmpiricalSoftwareEngineering(2020)25:4927\u20134961 4929\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply.

As social distancing\ncloses worksites and reduces commerce, governments face increased economic pressure to\nend social distancing requirements prematurely (Loose et al. 2010 ). Maintaining remote\nworkers\u2019 health and productivity is therefore important for maintaining social distancing as\nlong as is necessary (Blake et al. 2010 ).\nAs we prepare this article, many other studies of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effects are\nunderway. Early evidence suggests complicated effects on productivity, which vary by per-\nson, project and metric (Bao et al. 2020 ). Some evidence suggests programmers are working\nlonger hours, at an unsustainable pace (Forsgren 2020 ).\n2.2 WorkingfromHome\nP\u00b4erez et al. ( 2004 ) defines teleworking (also called remote working ) as \u201corganisation of\nwork by using information and communication technologies that enable employees and\nmanagers to access their labour activities from remote locations\u201d (p. 280). It includes work-\ning from home, a satellite office, a telework centre or even a coffee shop. Remote working\ncan help restore and maintain operational capacity and essential services during and after\ndisasters (Blake et al. 2010 ), especially when workplaces are inaccessible. Indeed, many\nexecutives are already planning to shift \u201cat least 5% of previously on-site employees to\npermanently remote positions post-COVID 19\u201d (Lavelle 2020 ).\nHowever, many organizations lack appropriate plans, supportive policies, resources or\nmanagement practices for practising home-based telework. In disasters such as pandemics\nwhere public facilities are closed and people are required to stay at home, their experi-\nence and capacity to work can be limited by lack of dedicated workspace at home, caring\nresponsibilities and organizational resources (Donnelly and Proctor-Thomson 2015 ).\nIn general, working from home is often claimed to improve productivity (Davenport and\nPearlson 1998 ;M c I n e r n e y 1999 ; Cascio 2000 ) and teleworkers consistently report increased\nperceived productivity (Duxbury et al. 1998 ;B a r u c h 2000 ). Interestingly, Baker et al. ( 2007 )\nfound that organizational and job-related factors (e.g. management culture, human resources\nsupport, structure of feedback) are more likely to affect teleworking employees\u2019 satisfaction\nand perceived productivity than work styles (e.g. planning vs. improvising) and house-\nhold characteristics (e.g. number of children). While increasing productivity, \u201cworking from\nhome is associated with greater levels of both work pressure and work-life conflict\u201d (Rus-\nsell et al. 2009 ) because work intrudes into developers\u2019 home lives through working unpaid\novertime, thinking about work in off hours, exhaustion and sleeplessness (Hyman et al.\n2003 ).\nMoreover, individuals\u2019 wellbeing while working remotely is influenced by their emo-\ntional stability (that is, a person\u2019s ability to control their emotions when stressed). For people\nwith high emotional stability, working from home provides more autonomy and fosters\nwellbeing; however, for employees with low emotional stability, it can exacerbate physical,\nsocial and psychological strain (Perry et al. 2018 ). The COVID-19 pandemic has not been\ngood for emotional stability (ARI 2020 ).\nResearch on working from home has been criticized for relying on self-reports of\nperceived productivity, which may inflate its benefits (Bailey and Kurland 2002 ); how-\never, objective measures often lack construct validity (Ralph and Tempero 2018 )a n d\nperceived productivity correlates well with managers\u2019 appraisals (Baruch 1996 ). (The per-\nceived productivity scale we use below correlates well with objective performance data; cf.\nSection 4.2).4930 EmpiricalSoftwareEngineering(2020)25:4927\u20134961\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply. Rights reserved."}, {"source": "sources/todo/Pandemic_programming_How_COVID-19_affects_software.pdf", "content": "2.3 ProductivityandWellbeing\nPrevious studies suggest that productivity affects project outcomes and is affected by numerous\nfactors including team size and technologies used (McLeod and MacDonell 2011 ). How-\never, existing research on developer productivity is rife with construct validity problems.\nProductivity is the amount of work done per unit of time. Measuring time is simple but\nquantifying the work done by a software developer is not. Some researchers (e.g. Jaspan\nand Sadowski 2019 ) argue for using goal-specific metrics. Others reject the whole idea of\nmeasuring productivity (e.g. Ko AJ 2019 ) not least because people tend to optimize for\nwhatever metric is being used\u2014a phenomenon known as Goodhart\u2019s law (Goodhart 1984 ;\nChrystal and Mizen 2003 ).\nFurthermore, simple productivity measures such as counting commits or modified lines\nof code in a certain period suffer from low construct validity (Ralph and Tempero 2018 ). The\nimportance and difficulty of a commit does not necessarily correlate with its size. Similarly,\nsome developers might prefer dense, one-line solutions while others like to arrange their\ncontributions in several lines.\nNevertheless, large companies including Microsoft still use controversial metrics such\nas number of pull requests as a \u201cproxy for productivity\u201d (Spataro 2020 ), and individual develop-\ners also use them to monitor their own performance (Baltes and Diehl 2018 ). Copious time\ntracking tools exist for that purpose\u2014some specifically tailored for software developers.1\nWhile researchers have adapted existing scales to measure related phenomena like hap-\npiness (e.g. Graziotin and Fagerholm 2019 ), there is no widespread consensus about how\nto measure developers\u2019 productivity or the main antecedents thereof. Many researchers use\nsimple, unvalidated productivity scales; for example, Meyer et al. ( 2017 ) used a single\nquestion asking participants to rate themselves from \u201cnot productive\u201d to \u201cvery productive.\u201d\n(The perceived productivity scale we use below has been repeatedly validated in multiple\ndomains; cf. Section 4.2).\nMeanwhile, a programmer\u2019s productivity is closely related to their job satisfaction\n(Storey et al. 2019 ) and emotional state (Wrobel 2013 ; Graziotin et al. 2015 ). Unhappi-\nness, specifically, leads to \u201clow cognitive performance, mental unease or disorder, and low\nmotivation\u201d (Graziotin et al. 2017 , p. 44). However, little is known about the antecedents or\nconsequences of software professionals\u2019 physical or mental wellbeing in general.\n3 Hypotheses\nThe related work discussed above suggests numerous hypotheses. Here we hypothesize\nabout \u201cdevelopers\u201d even though our survey was open to all software professionals because\nmost respondents were developers (see Section 5.3). These hypotheses were generated\ncontemporaneously with questionnaire design\u2014before data collection began.\nHypothesis H1: Developers will have lower wellbeing while working from home due\nto COVID-19 . Stress, isolation, travel restrictions, business closures and the absence of\neducational, child care and fitness facilities all take a toll on those working from home.\nIndeed, a pandemic\u2019s severity and the uncertainty and isolation it induces create frustration,\nanxiety and fear (Taha et al. 2014 ; DiGiovanni et al. 2004 ; Teasdale et al. 2012 ). It therefore\nseems likely that many developers will experience reduced emotional wellbeing.\n1e.g.https://wakatime.com/EmpiricalSoftwareEngineering(2020)25:4927\u20134961 4931\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply. Rights reserved."}, {"source": "sources/todo/Pandemic_programming_How_COVID-19_affects_software.pdf", "content": "Hypothesis H2: Developers will have lower perceived productivity while working\nfrom home due to COVID-19 . Similarly, stress, moving to an impromptu home office, and\nlack of child care and other amenities may reduce many developers\u2019 productivity. Many\npeople are likely more distracted by the people they live with and their own worrisome\nthoughts. People tend to experience lower motivation, productivity and commitment while\nworking from home in a disaster situation (Donnelly and Proctor-Thomson 2015 ).\nAssuming Hypotheses H1 and H2 are supported, we want to propose a model that\nexplains and predicts changes in wellbeing and productivity (Fig. 1). Hypotheses H1 and H2\nare encapsulated in the change in wellbeing andchange in perceived productivity constructs.\nThe model only makes sense if wellbeing and productivity have changed since developers\nbegan working from home.\nHypothesis H3: Change in wellbeing and change in perceived productivity are\ndirectly related . We expect wellbeing and productivity to exhibit reciprocal causality. That\nis, as we feel worse, we become less productive, and feeling less productive makes us\nfeel even worse, in a downward spiral. Many studies show that productivity and wellbe-\ning covary (cf. Dall\u2019Ora et al. 2016 ). Moreover, Evers et al. ( 2014 ) found that people with\nincreasing health risks have lower wellbeing and life satisfaction, leading to higher rates\nof depression and anxiety. Conversely, decreasing health risk will increase physical and\nemotional wellbeing and productivity.\nHypotheses H4 and H5: Disaster preparedness is directly related to change in well-\nbeing and change in perceived productivity . Disaster preparedness is the degree to which\na person is ready for a natural disaster. It includes behaviors like having an emergency sup-\nply kit and complying with directions from authorities. We expect lack of preparedness for\ndisasters in general and for COVID-19 in particular to exacerbate reductions in wellbeing\nand productivity, and vice versa (cf. Paton 2008 ; Donnelly and Proctor-Thomson 2015 ).\nHypotheses H6 and H7: Fear (of the pandemic) is inversely related to change in\nwellbeing and change in perceived productivity . Fear is a common reaction to bioevents\nlike pandemics. Emerging research on COVID-19 is already showing a negative effect on\nwellbeing, particularly anxiety (Harper et al. 2020 ; Xiang et al. 2020 ). Meanwhile, fear of\ninfection and public health measures cause psychosocial distress, increased absenteeism and\nreduced productivity (Shultz et al. 2016 ;T h o m m e se ta l . 2016 ).\nHypotheses H8 and H9: Home office ergonomics is directly related to change in\nwellbeing and change in perceived productivity . Here we use ergonomics in its broadest\nsense of the degree to which an environment is safe, comfortable and conducive to the\ntasks being completed in it. We are not interested in measuring the angle of a developer\u2019s\nFig.1 Theoretical model of developer wellbeing and productivity4932 EmpiricalSoftwareEngineering(2020)25:4927\u20134961\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply.

Professionals with more\nergonomic home offices should have greater wellbeing and be more productive. Donnelly\nand Proctor-Thomson ( 2015 ) found that availability of a dedicated work-space at home,\nliving circumstances, and the availability of organisational resources to work relate to the\ncapacity to return to work after a disaster and employees\u2019 productivity.\nHypothesis H10: Disaster preparedness is inversely related to fear (of the pan-\ndemic) . It seems intuitive that the more prepared we are for a disaster, the more resilient\nand less afraid we will be when the disaster occurs. Indeed, Ronan et al.\u2019s 2015 systematic\nreview found that programs for increasing disaster preparedness had a small- to medium-\nsized negative effect on fear. People who have high self-efficacy and response-efficacy (i.e.\nperceive themselves as ready to face a disaster) will be less afraid (Roberto et al. 2009 ).\n4 Method\nOn March 19, 2020, the first author initiated a survey to investigate how COVID-19 affects\ndevelopers, and recruited the second and third authors for help. We created the questionnaire\nand it was approved by Dalhousie University\u2019s research ethics board in less than 24 hours.\nWe began data collection on March 27th. We then recruited authors 5 through 17, who\ntranslated and localized the questionnaire into Arabic, (Mandarin) Chinese, English, French,\nItalian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian and Turkish, and created\nregion-specific advertising strategies. Translations launched between April 5 and 7, and we\ncompleted data collection between April 12 and 16. Next, we recruited the fourth author\nto assist with the data analysis, which was completed on April 29. The manuscript was\nprepared primarily by the first four authors with edits from the rest of team.\nThis section details our approach and instrumentation.\n4.1 PopulationandInclusionCriteria\nThis study\u2019s target population is software developers anywhere in the world who switched\nfrom working in an office to working from home because of COVID-19. Of course, devel-\nopers who had been working remotely before the pandemic and developers who continued\nworking in offices throughout the pandemic are also important, but this study is about the\nswitch, and the questions are designed for people who switched from working on-site to at\nhome.\nIn principle, the questionnaire was open to all sorts of software professionals, including\ndesigners, quality assurance specialists, product managers, architects and business analysts,\nbut we are mainly interested in developers, our marketing focused on software developers,\nand therefore most respondents identify as developers (see Section 5.3).\n4.2 InstrumentDesign\nWe created an anonymous questionnaire survey. We did not use URL tracking or tokens.\nWe did not collect contact information.\nQuestions were organized into blocks corresponding to scale or question type. The order\nof the items in each multi-item scale was randomized to mitigate primacy and recency\neffects. The order of blocks was not randomized because our pilot study (Section 4.3) sug-\ngested that the questionnaire was more clear when the questions that distinguish between\nbefore and after the switch to home working came after those that do not.EmpiricalSoftwareEngineering(2020)25:4927\u20134961 4933\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply.

Respondents who had not switched from working in an office to working\nfrom home because of COVID-19 simply skipped to the end of the questionnaire. It also\nincluded not only traditional demographic variables (e.g. age, gender, country, experience,\neducation) but also how many adults and children (under twelve) participants lived with, the\nextent to which participants are staying home and whether they or any friends or family had\ntested positive for COVID-19.\nThe questionnaire used validated scales as much as possible to improve construct valid-\nity. A construct is a quantity that cannot be measured directly. Fear, disaster preparedness,\nhome office ergonomics, wellbeing and productivity are all constructs. In contrast, age,\ncountry, and number of children are all directly measurable. Direct measurements are\nassumed to have inherent validity, but latent variables have to be validated to ensure that\nthey measure the right properties (cf. Ralph and Tempero 2018 ).\nThe exact question wording can be seen in our replication pack (see Section 8). This\nsection describes the scales and additional questions.\nEmotionalwellbeing(WHO-5) To assess emotional wellbeing, we used the WHO\u2019s five-\nitem wellbeing index (WHO-5).2Each item is assessed on a six-point scale from \u201cat no\ntime\u201d (0) to \u201call of the time\u201d (5). The scale can be calculated by summing the items or using\nfactor analysis. The WHO-5 scale is widely used, widely applicable, and has high sensitivity\nand construct validity (Topp et al. 2015 ). Respondents self-assessed their wellbeing twice:\nonce for the four weeks prior to beginning to work from home, and then again for the time\nthey have been working from home.\nPerceived Productivity (HPQ) To assess perceived productivity we used items from the\nWHO\u2019s Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ).3The HPQ measures per-\nceived productivity in two ways: (1) using an eight-item summative scale, with multiple\nreversed indicators, that assesses overall and relative performance; and (2) using 11-point\ngeneral ratings of participants\u2019 own performance and typical performance of similar work-\ners. These scales are amenable to factor analysis or summation. Of course, people tend to\noverestimate their performance relative to their peers, but we are comparing participants to\ntheir past selves not to each other. HPQ scores are closely related to objective performance\ndata in diverse fields (Kessler et al. 2003 ). Again, respondents self-assessed their produc-\ntivity for both the four weeks prior to working from home, and for the time they have been\nworking from home.\nDisaster Preparedness (DP) To assess disaster preparedness, we adapted Yong et al.\u2019s\n(2017 ) individual disaster preparedness scale. Yong et al. developed their five-item,\nfive-point, Likert scale based on common, important behaviors such as complying with gov-\nernment recommendations and having emergency supplies. The scale was validated using a\nquestionnaire survey of a \u201cweighted nationally representative sample\u201d of 1084 Canadians.\nWe adapted the items to refer specifically to COVID-19. It can be computed by summing\nthe responses or using factor analysis.\n2https://www.psykiatri-regionh.dk/who-5/who-5-questionnaires/Pages/default.aspx\n3https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/hpq/info.php4934 EmpiricalSoftwareEngineering(2020)25:4927\u20134961\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply.

The FR check-\nlist places the patient on a scale from intense fear to hyper-resilience (Bracha and Burkle\n2006 ). We dropped some of the more extreme items (e.g. \u201cRight now are you experiencing\nshortness of breath?\u201d) because respondents are at home taking a survey, not arriving in a\nhospital emergency room. The FR checklist is a weighted summative scale so it has to be\ncomputed manually using Bracha and Burkle\u2019s formula rather than using factor analysis. It\nhas multiple reversed indicators.\nErgonomics We could not find a reasonable scale for evaluating home office ergonomics.\nThere is comparatively less research on the ergonomics of home offices (Inalhan and Ng\n2010 ) and ergonomic instruments tend to be too narrow (e.g. evaluating hip angle). Based on\nour reading of the ergonomics literature, we made a simple six-item, six-point Likert scale\nconcerning distractions, noise, lighting, temperature, chair comfort and overall ergonomics.\nAgain, we evaluated the scale\u2019s face and content validity using a pilot study (see\nSection 4.3) and examine convergent and discriminant validity ex post in Section 5.2.\nOrganizationalSupport(OS) We could not find any existing instrument that measures the\ndegree to which an organization supports its employees during a crisis. The first author\ntherefore interviewed three developers with experience in both co-located and distributed\nteams as well as office work and working from home. Interviewees brainstormed actions\ncompanies could take to help, and we used open-coding (Salda \u02dcna2015 ) to organize their\nresponses into five themes:\n1. Equipment: providing equipment employees need in their home office (e.g. a second\nmonitor)\n2. Reassurance: adopting a tone that removes doubt and fear (e.g. assuring employees that\nlower productivity would be understood)\n3. Connectedness: encouraging virtual socializing (e.g. through video chat)\n4. Self-care: providing personal services not directly related to work (e.g. resources for\nexercising or home-schooling children)\n5. Technical infrastructure and practices: ensuring that remote infrastructure (e.g. VPNs)\nand practices (e.g. code review) are in place.\nWe generated a list of 22 actions (four or five per theme) by synthesizing the ideas of\ninterviewees with existing literature on working from home, distributed development and\nsoftware engineering more generally. For each action, respondents indicate whether their\nemployer is taking the action and whether they think it is or would be helpful. Organiza-\ntional support is not a construct in our theory per se because we have insufficient a priori\ninformation to produce a quantitative estimate, so we analyze these answers separately.\n4.3 Pilot\nWe solicited feedback from twelve colleagues: six software engineering academics and six\nexperienced software developers. Pilot participants made various comments on the ques-\ntionnaire structure, directions and on the face and content validity of the scales. Based on\nthis feedback we made numerous changes including clarifying directions, making the ques-\ntion order static, moving the WHO-5 and HPQ scales closer to the end, dropping some\nproblematic questions, splitting up an overloaded question, and adding some open responseEmpiricalSoftwareEngineering(2020)25:4927\u20134961 4935\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply.

(Free-text answers are not analyzed in this paper; open response questions were\nincluded mainly to inform future research; see Section 6.3).\n4.4 Sampling,LocalizationandIncentives\nWe advertised our survey on social and conventional media, including Dev.to,\nD\u00b4eveloppez.com, DNU.nl, eksisozluk, Facebook, Hacker News, Heise Online, InfoQ,\nLinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit andWeChat . Upon completion, participants were provided a link\nand encouraged to share it with colleagues who might also like to take the survey. Because\nthis is an anonymous survey, we did not ask respondents to provide colleagues\u2019 email\naddresses.\nWe considered several alternatives, including scraping emails from software reposito-\nries and stratified random sampling using company lists, but none of these options seemed\nlikely to produce a more representative sample. Granted, if we sampled from an understood\nsampling frame, we could better evaluate the representativeness of the sample and general-\nizability of the results; however, we are not aware of any sampling frames with sufficiently\nwell-understood demographics to facilitate accurate inferences.\nInstead, we focused on increasing the diversity of the sample by localizing the survey\nand promoting it in more jurisdictions. We translated the survey into Arabic, (Mandarin)\nChinese, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian and Turk-\nish. Each author-translator translated from English into their first language. We capitalized\non each authors\u2019 local knowledge to reach more people in their jurisdiction. Rather than a\nsingle, global campaign, we used a collection of local campaigns.\nEach localization involved small changes in wording. Only a few significant changes\nwere needed. The Chinese version used a different questionnaire system ( https://wjx.cn )\nbecause Google Forms is not available in China. Furthermore, because the lockdowns in\nChina and Korea were ending, we reworded some questions from \u201csince you began working\nfrom home\u201d to \u201cwhile you were working from home.\u201d\nWe did not offer cash incentives for participation. Rather, we offered to donate US$500\nto an open source project chosen by participants (in one of the open response questions).\nRespondents suggested a wide variety of projects, so we donated US$100 to the five most\nmentioned: The Linux Foundation, The Wikimedia Foundation, The Mozilla Foundation,\nThe Apache Software Foundation and the Free Software Foundation. The Portuguese ver-\nsion was slightly different: it promised to donate 1000 BRL to Ac \u00b8\u02dcao da Cidadania\u2019s (a\nBrazillian NGO) Action against Corona project rather than a project chosen by participants\n(which we did).\n5 AnalysisandResults\nWe received 2668 total responses of which 439 did not meet our inclusion criteria and 4\nwere effectively blank (see below) leaving 2225. This section describes how the data was\ncleaned and analyzed.\n5.1 DataCleaning\nThe data was cleaned as follows.\n1. Delete responses that do not meet inclusion criteria.4936 EmpiricalSoftwareEngineering(2020)25:4927\u20134961\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply. Rights reserved."}, {"source": "sources/todo/Pandemic_programming_How_COVID-19_affects_software.pdf", "content": "2. Delete almost empty rows, where the respondent apparently answered the filter\nquestion correctly, then skipped all other questions.\n3. Delete the timestamp field (to preserve anonymity), the consent form confirmation\nfield (because participants could not continue without checking these boxes so the\nanswer is always \u201cTRUE\u201d) and the filter question field (because all remaining rows\nhave the same answer).\n4. Add a binary field indicating whether the respondent had entered text in at least one\nlong-answer question (see Section 5.2).\n5. Move all free-text responses to a separate file (to preserve anonymity).\n6. Recode the raw data (which is in different languages with different alphabets) into a\ncommon quantitative coding scheme; for example, from 1 for \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d to 5\nfor \u201cstrongly agree\u201d The recoding instructions and related scripts are included in our\nreplication package (see Section 8).\n7. Split select-multiple questions into one binary variable per checkbox (Google Forms\nuses a comma-separated list of the text of selected answers).\n8. Add a field indicating the language of the response.\n9. Combine the responses into a single data file.\n10. Calculate the FR scale according to its formula (Bracha and Burkle 2006 ).\n5.2 ValidityAnalysis\nWe evaluated construct validity using established guidelines (Ralph and Tempero 2018 ).\nFirst, we assessed content validity using a pilot study (Section 4.3). Next, we assessed\nconvergent and discriminant validity using a principle component analysis (PCA) with Vari-\nmax rotation and Kaiser normalization. Bartlett\u2019s test is significant ( \u03c72=13229 ;df=\n253;p< 0.001) and our KMO measure of sampling adequacy is high (0.874), indicating\nthat our data is appropriate for factor analysis.\nAs Table 1shows, the items load well but not perfectly. The bold coefficients suggest\npossible issues with Change in Productivity ( /Delta1Productivity) 7 and 9, as well as Ergonomics\n1. We dropped items one at a time until the loadings stabilized, starting with /Delta1Productivity\n7, followed by /Delta1Productivity 9. As shown in Table 2, dropping these two indicators solved\nthe problem with Ergonomics 1, so the latter is retained.\nWe evaluate predictive validity by testing our hypotheses in Section 5.4.\nResponse bias Here, response bias refers to the possibility that people for whom one of\nour hypotheses hold are more likely to take the questionnaire, thus inflating the results.\nThere are two basic ways to analyze this kind of response bias. The first\u2014comparing\nsample parameters to known population parameters\u2014is impractical because no one has ever\nestablished population parameters for software professionals. The second\u2014comparing late\nrespondents to early respondents\u2014cannot be used because we do not know the time between\neach respondent learning of the survey and completing it. However, we can do something\nsimilar: we can compare respondents who answered one or more open response questions\n(more keen on the survey) with those who skipped the open response questions (less keen\non the survey).\nAs shown in Table 3, only number of adult cohabitants and age have significant differ-\nences, and in both cases, the effect size ( \u03b72) is very small. This is consistent with minimal\nresponse bias.EmpiricalSoftwareEngineering(2020)25:4927\u20134961 4937\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply.

Mean work experience is 9.3 years ( \u03c3=7.3). Mean experience working from home\nis 1.3 years ( \u03c3=2.5); however, 58% of respondents had no experience working from home\nbefore COVID-19.\nParticipants hail from 53 countries (Table 4) and organizations ranging from 0\u20139 employ-\nees to more than 100,000 (Fig. 3).

Briefly,\nSEM is used to test theories involving constructs (also called latent variables). A construct\nis a quantity that cannot be measured directly (Ralph and Tempero 2018 ). Fear, disaster\npreparedness, home office ergonomics, wellbeing and productivity are all constructs. In\ncontrast, age, country, and number of children are all directly measurable.\nTo design a structural equation model, we first define a measurement model , which maps\neach reflective indicator into its corresponding construct. For example, each of the five items\ncomprising the WHO-5 wellbeing scale is modeled as a reflective indicator of wellbeing.\nSEM uses confirmatory factor analysis to estimate each construct as the shared variance of\nits respective indicators.\nNext, we define the structural model , which defines the expected relationships among\nthe constructs. The constructs we are attempting to predict are referred to as endogenous ,\nwhile the predictors are exogenous .\nSEM uses a path modeling technique (e.g. regression) to build a model that predicts the\nendogenous (latent) variables based on the exogenous variables, and to estimate both the\nstrength of each relationship and the overall accuracy of the model.4\nAs mentioned, the first step in a SEM analysis is to conduct a confirmatory factor anal-\nysis to verify that the measurement model is consistent (Table 5). Here, the latent concepts\nErgonomics and DisasterPreparedness are captured by their respective exogenous variables.\nFear is not included because it is computed manually (see Section 4.2)./Delta1Wellbeing is the\ndifference in a participant\u2019s emotional wellbeing before and after switching to working from\nhome. This latent concept is captured by five exogenous variables, /Delta1WB1,...,/Delta1 WB5.\nSimilarly, /Delta1Productivity represents the difference in perceived productivity, before and after\nswitching to working from home.\nThe confirmatory factor analysis converged (not converging would suggest a problem\nwith the measurement model) and all of the indicators load well on their constructs. The\nlowest estimate, 0.716 for DP2, is still quite good. The estimates for /Delta1P2 through /Delta1P6 are\nnegative because these items were reversed (i.e. higher score = worse productivity). Note\nthat factor loadings greater than one do not indicate a problem because they are regression\ncoefficients, not correlations (J \u00a8oreskog 1999 ).\nHaving reached confidence in our measurement model, we construct our structural model\nby representing all of the hypotheses stated in Section 3as regressions (e.g. /Delta1Wellbeing \u223c\nDisasterPreparedness + Fear + Ergonomics).\nIn principle, we use all control variables as predictors for all latent variables. In prac-\ntice, however, this leads to too many relationships and prevents the model from converging.\nTherefore, we evaluate the predictive power of each control variable, one at a time, and\ninclude it in a regression only where it makes at least a marginally significant ( p< 0.1)\ndifference. Here, using a higher than normal p-value is more conservative because we are\ndropping predictors rather than testing hypotheses. Country of residence and language of\nquestionnaire are not included because SEM does not respond well to nominal categorical\nvariables (see Section 5.6).\n4Data was analyzed using the Rpackage lavaan 0.6-5 available at http://lavaan.ugent.be/ .4942 EmpiricalSoftwareEngineering(2020)25:4927\u20134961\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply.

Note: error terms, unsupported hypotheses\nand control variables are omitted for clarity\nSome indirect effects are also apparent, but are more difficult to interpret. For example,\nchanges in productivity and wellbeing are closely related. Hypothesis H4 may be unsup-\nported because change in productivity is mediating the effect of disaster preparedness on\nchange in wellbeing. Similarly, Hypothesis H7 may not be unsupported because change\nin wellbeing is mediating the relationship between fear and change in productivity. Fur-\nthermore, control variables including gender, children and disability may have significant\neffects on wellbeing or productivity that are not obvious because they are mediated by\nanother construct. Some variables have conflicting effects. For example, disability has not\nonly a direct positive effect on productivity but also an indirect negative effect (through\nfear). So, is the pandemic harder on people with disabilities? More research is needed to\nexplore these relationships.\nAbove, we mentioned omitting language and country because SEM does not respond\nwell to nominal categorical variables. We tried anyway, and both language and country were\nsignificant predictors for all latent variables, but, as expected, including so many binary\ndummy variables makes the model impossible to interpret.

Future work could investigate a better selection of actions, and possibly ask partic-\nipants for their \u201ctop N\u201d items to improve reliability. Moreover, the helpfulness of actions\nmay depend on where the participant lives; for example, in countries with a weaker social\nsafety net, reassuring employees that they will keep their jobs, pay and benefits may be\nmore important.\n5.8 SummaryInterpretation\nThis study shows that software professionals who are working from home during the pan-\ndemic are experiencing diminished emotional wellbeing and productivity, which are closely\nrelated. Furthermore, poor disaster preparedness, fear related to the pandemic, and poor\nhome office ergonomics are exacerbating this reduction in wellbeing and productivity.\nMoreover, women, parents and people with disabilities may be disproportionately affected.\nIn addition, dissensus regarding what organizations can do to help suggests that no single\naction is universally helpful; rather, different people need different kinds of support.\n6 Discussion\n6.1 Recommendations\nOrganizations need to accept that expecting normal productivity under these circumstances\nis unrealistic. Pressuring employees to maintain normal productivity will likely make\nmatters worse. Furthermore, companies should avoid making any decisions (e.g. layoffs,\npromotions, bonuses) based on productivity during the pandemic because any such deci-\nsion may be prejudiced against protected groups. If a member of a protected group feels\ndiscriminated against due to low productivity at this time, we recommend contacting your\nlocal human rights commission or equivalent organization.\nBecause productivity and wellbeing are so closely related, the best way to improve\nproductivity is to help employees maintain their emotional wellbeing. However, no single\naction appears beneficial to everyone, so organizations should talk to their employees to\ndetermine what they need.\nHelping employees improve the ergonomics of their work spaces, in particular, should\nhelp. However, micromanaging foot positions, armrests and hip angles is not what we mean\nby ergonomics. Rather, companies should ask broad questions such as \u201cwhat do you need\nto limit distractions and be more comfortable?\u201d Shipping an employee a new office chair or\nnoise cancelling headphones could help significantly.\nMeanwhile, professionals should try to accept that their productivity may be lower and\nstop stressing about it. Similarly, professionals should try to remember that different people\nare experiencing the pandemic in very different ways\u2014some people may be more produc-\ntive than normal while others struggle to complete any work through no fault of their own.\nIt is crucial to support each other and avoid inciting conflict over who is working harder.\n6.2 LimitationsandThreatstoValidity\nThe above recommendations should be considered in the context of the study\u2019s limitations.\nSampling bias Random sampling of software developers is rare (Amir and Ralph 2018 )\nbecause there are no lists of all the software developers, projects, teams or organizations in4948 EmpiricalSoftwareEngineering(2020)25:4927\u20134961\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply. Rights reserved."}, {"source": "sources/todo/Pandemic_programming_How_COVID-19_affects_software.pdf", "content": "the world or particular jurisdictions (Baltes and Ralph 2020 ). We therefore combined conve-\nnience and snowball sampling with a strategy of finding a co-author with local knowledge to\ntranslate, localize and advertise the questionnaire in a locally effective way. On one hand, the\nconvenience/snowball strategy may bias the sample in unknown ways. On the other hand,\nour translation and localization strategy demonstrably increased sample diversity, leading to\none of the largest and broadest samples of developers ever studied, possible due to a large,\ninternational and diverse research team. Any random sample of English-speaking devel-\nopers is comparatively ethnocentric. The sample is not balanced; for instance, many more\nrespondents live in Germany than all of southeast Asia, but we attempt to correct for that\n(see Internal Validity ,b e l o w ) .\nResponseBias Meanwhile, we found minimal evidence of response bias (in Section 5.2).\nHowever, because the questionnaire is anonymous and Google Forms does not record\nincomplete responses, response bias can only be estimated in a limited way. Someone could\nhave taken the survey more than once or entered fake data. Additionally, large responses\nfrom within a single country could skew the data but we correct for company size, language\nand numerous demographic variables to mitigate this.\nConstructvalidity To enhance construct validity, we used validated scales for wellbeing,\nproductivity, disaster preparedness and fear/resilience. Post-hoc construct validity analy-\nsis suggests that all four scales, as well as the ergonomics scale we created, are sound\n(Section 5.2). However, perceived productivity is not the same as actual productivity.\nAlthough the HPQ scale correlates well with objective performance data in other fields\n(Kessler et al. 2003 ), it may not in software development or during pandemics. Similarly,\nwe asked respondents their opinion of numerous potential mechanisms for organizational\nsupport. Just because companies are taking some action (e.g. having regular meetings) or\nrespondents believe in the helpfulness of some action (e.g. paying their internet bills), does\nnot mean that those actions will actually improve productivity or wellbeing.\nMeasurement Validity. There is much debate about whether 5- and 6-point responses\nshould be treated as ordinal or interval. CFA and SEM are often used with these kinds of\nvariables in social sciences despite assuming at least interval data. Some evidence suggests\nthat CFA is robust against moderate deviations from normality, including arguably-ordinal\nquestionnaire items (cf. Flora and Curran 2004 ). We tend not to worry about treating data\nas interval as long as, in principle, the data is drawn from a continuous distribution. Addi-\ntionally, due to a manual error, the Italian version was missing organizational support item\n11: \u201cMy team uses a build system to automate compilation and testing.\u201d The survey may\ntherefore under-count the frequency and importance of this item by up to 10%.\nConclusionvalidity. We use structural equation modeling to fit a theoretical model to the\ndata. Indicators of model fit suggest that the model is sound. Moreover, SEM enhances\nconclusion validity by correcting for multiple comparisons, measurement error (by inferring\nlatent variables based on observable variables), testing the entire model as a whole (instead\nof one hypothesis at a time) and controlling for extraneous variables (e.g. age, organization\nsize). SEM is considered superior to alternative path modeling techniques such as partial\nleast squares path modeling (R \u00a8onkk \u00a8o and Evermann 2013 ). While a Bayesian approach\nmight have higher conclusion validity (Furia et al. 2019 ), none of the Bayesian SEM tools\n(e.g. Blaavan ) we are aware of support ordered categorical variables. The main remaining\nthreat to conclusion validity is overfitting the structural model.

To infer causality, we must demonstrate correlation, precedence and\nthe absence of third variable explanations. SEM demonstrates correlation. SEM does not\ndemonstrate precedence; however, we can be more confident in causality where precedence\nonly makes sense in one direction. For example, having COVID-19 may reduce one\u2019s pro-\nductivity, but feeling unproductive cannot give someone a specific virus. Similarly, it seems\nmore likely that a more ergonomic office might make you more productive than that being\nmore productive leads to a more ergnomic office. Meanwhile, we statistically controlled for\nnumerous extraneous variables (e.g. age, gender, education level, organization size). How-\never, other third-variable explanations cannot be discounted. Developers who work more\novertime, for example, might have lower wellbeing, worse home office ergonomics, and\nreduced disaster preparedness. Other confounding variables might include individual differ-\nences (e.g. personality), team dynamics, organizational culture, family conflict, past medical\nhistory and wealth.\n6.3 ImplicationsforResearchersandFutureWork\nFor researchers, this paper opens a new research area intersecting software engineering and\ncrisis, disaster and emergency management. Although many studies explore remote work\nand distributed teams, we still need a better understanding of how stress, distraction and\nfamily commitments affect developers working from home during crises, bioevents and\ndisasters . More research is needed on how these events affect team dynamics, cohesion,\nperformance, as well as software development processes and practices.\nMore specifically, the dataset we publish alongside this paper can be significantly\nextended. Abundant quantitative data is available regarding different countries, and how\nthose countries reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic. Country data could be merged with our\ndataset to investigate how different contexts, cultures and political actions affect developers.\nFor example, the quality of a country\u2019s social safety net may affect fear.\nFurthermore, the crisis continues. More longitudinal research is needed to understand its\nlong-term effects on software professionals (e.g. burnout), projects (e.g. decreased velocity)\nand communities (e.g. trust issues). Research is also needed to understand how the crisis\naffects different kinds of professions. We focus on software developers because that is who\nsoftware engineering research is responsible for, in the same way nursing researchers will\nstudy nurses and management researchers will study managers. Only comparing studies\nof different groups will reveal the extent to which our findings are specific to software\nprofessionals or generalizable to other knowledge workers.\nThis study does not investigate typical software engineering practices (e.g. pair pro-\ngramming, mutation testing) or debates (e.g. agile methods vs. model-driven engineering)\nbecause we do not believe that a team\u2019s software development methodology is a key\nantecedent of pandemic-induced changes to productivity and wellbeing. Further research is\nneeded to confirm or refute our intuition.\n6.4 LessonsLearned\nThis study taught us two valuable lessons about research methodology. First, collaborating\nwith a large, diverse, international research team and releasing a questionnaire in multiple\nlanguages with location-specific advertising can generate a large, diverse, international\nsample of participants.\nSecond, Google Forms should not be used to conduct scientific questionnaire surveys. It\nis blocked in some countries. It does not record partial res ponses or bounce rates, hindering4950 EmpiricalSoftwareEngineering(2020)25:4927\u20134961\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply.

URL parameter passing, which is typically used to determine\nhow the respondent found out about the survey, is difficult. Exporting the data in differ-\nent ways gives different variable orders, encouraging mistakes. Responses are recorded as\n(sometimes long) strings instead of numbers, overcomplicating data analysis. We should\nhave used a research focused survey tool such as LimeSurvey(.org) orQualtrics(.com) .\n7 Conclusion\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created unique conditions for many software developers.\nStress, isolation, travel restrictions, business closures and the absence of educational, child\ncare and fitness facilities are all taking a toll. Working from home under these conditions is\nfundamentally different from normal working from home. This paper reports the first large-\nscale study of how working from home during a pandemic affects software developers. It\nmakes several key contributions:\n\u2013 evidence that productivity and wellbeing have declined;\n\u2013 evidence that productivity and wellbeing are closely related;\n\u2013 a model that explains and predicts the effects of the pandemic on productivity and\nwellbeing;\n\u2013 some indication that different people need different kinds of support from their\norganizations (there is no silver bullet here);\n\u2013 some indication that the pandemic may disproportionately affect women, parents and\npeople with disabilities.\nFurthermore, this study is exceptional in several ways: (1) the questionnaire used previ-\nously validated scales, which we re-validated using both principal components analysis and\nconfirmatory factor analysis; (2) the questionnaire attracted an unusually large sample of\n2225 responses; (3) the questionnaire ran in 12 languages, mitigating cultural biases; (4) the\ndata was analyzed using highly sophisticated methods (i.e. structural equation modelling),\nwhich rarely have been utilized in software engineering research; (5) the study investigates\nan emerging phenomenon, providing timely advice for organizations and professionals; (6)\nthe study incorporates research on emergency and disaster management, which is rarely\nconsidered in software engineering studies.\nWe hope that this study inspires more research on how software development is affected\nby crises, pandemics, lockdowns and other adverse conditions. As the climate crisis unfolds,\nmore research intersecting disaster management and software engineering will be needed.\n8 DataAvailability\nA comprehensive replication package including our (anonymous) dataset, instruments and\nanalysis scripts is stored in the Zonodo open data archive at https://zenodo.org/record/\n3783511 .\nAcknowledgements This project was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research\nCouncil of Canada Grant RGPIN-2020-05001, the Government of Spain through project \u201cBugBirth\u201d\n(RTI2018-101963-B-100), Dalhousie University and the University of Adelaide.
