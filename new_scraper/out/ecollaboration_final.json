\u201cpure\u201d prototyping (Brooks, 1975), an incremental \nmodel can be considered more adequate, leading to \nthe development of more advanced prototypes in the \nsubsequent cycles.In face of construction and maintenance difficulties, \nthe groupware developer spent more time dealing with \ntechnical difficulties than moderating and providing \nsupport to the interaction among users.\n\nSuch problems \nled to the need to create a quicker and more effective \nway to develop groupware in which low-level complexi -\nties resulting from distributed and multi-user systems \nwere
